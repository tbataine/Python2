# Object-oriented programming (OOP)
Is a programming paradigm that revolves around objects rather than actions and data rather than logic. Here are some key concepts:
1. Classes and Objects: A class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances). It defines attributes (data members) and methods (functions) that the objects can use.
2. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It hides the internal state of objects from outside interference and manipulation.
3. Inheritance: Inheritance allows one class (subclass or derived class) to inherit the properties and methods of another class (superclass or base class). It promotes code reusability and supports hierarchical classification.
4. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables flexibility and dynamic behavior in programming.
5. Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It helps manage complexity and increases efficiency.

### Conclusion
In practice, OOP helps in organizing code, making it more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain. Classes serve as the blueprints for creating objects, which are instances of those classes, allowing for efficient and structured programming.
